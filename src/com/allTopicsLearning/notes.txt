we can handle null pointer exception by first checking instanceof and then working on objects.
Instanceof – returns true or false.

Instanceof – can also tell us whether relationship exist between parent and child.

Instanceof solves null pointer exception and class cast exceptions.

Upcasting-
Casting to super type. Also known as casting to parent class object.
Downcasting –
Casting to child class object.

parent cannot be instance of child.
child is by default instance of parent.

Child class can access all methods in inheritance hierarchy.

String s1=”abcd”; -> this are literals or constants or variable with value as literal.

With objects == fails. Only equals works.

== doesn’t work for objects.
== works only for literals.
